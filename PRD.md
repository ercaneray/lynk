- **Report Users**: Users can report inappropriate behavior to moderators.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or styled-components
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO)

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO)

### Deployment
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate growing user base.
- **Security**: Implement measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Usability**: The application should be user-friendly and accessible.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to create an account so that I can use the application.
- As a user, I want to join chat rooms so that I can communicate with others.
- As a moderator, I want to ban users who violate rules so that the chat room remains safe.
